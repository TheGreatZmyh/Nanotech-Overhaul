alloy tier 2
specialised rare resources buildings or upgrade to existing one
rare resource building for dark matter (needs something more than just nanites)
decision to recycle ships/pops

Nanotech world will get bonuses to 
less bombardment damage (-25% more or less)
+50% speed in  devastation decay (Cuz duh nanits) Parciwal says that pretrigger is needed and gatekeeper to make it work  
(If a system was occupied, we could check if the planet was bombardet and then do a staggered event fire (with multiple fires with delay). That would require 3 events i think, one that triggers the second if a system is occupied, the second calls itself until the system is unoccupied and the devastion is 0, and if the devastation ever gets above 0 and bombardment stops, the 3rd event would trigger monthly decreasing devestation by some amount until it's 0 so the second event stops. (Bearbeitet))


Nanotech Arcologies(maybe ask Planteray diversity dev to do it)

Starbase building 
Nanite Stellar Diffuse 
Creates Artificial Nanite Storm 
Blocks Sensors
Decreases enemy fire rate and ship speed 
Decreases enemy Armor hit points by -25%



Advanced Nanite  Authority(TO DO)
1 for non machine intellegence
1 for machine intelligence
nanite purge option
way to completely consume planets (at least 1 mil nanites, prob scale of planet size)
static opinion debuff
new bombardment stance
More nanite Edicts
Increase upkeep and output of all buildings on nanite worlds/ Nanite consumeng buildings (to add as mauch compat as possible)

Make a trait that gives nanite consumption but increases assembly speed (like budding but even better)
Trait that boosts output but also increases nanite consumption of nanite buildings (governor special perk) 

Make a decision allowing Obsessional directive to turn entire planets into a consumer goods( can be uninhabited but it destroys all deposits and gives little consumer goods)


Nanotech related Crisis path (only for machine intelligence)
5 levels cuz UI will break if not 5
