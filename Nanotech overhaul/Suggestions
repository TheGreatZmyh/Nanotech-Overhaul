More nanite Edicts
Increase upkeep and output of all buildings on nanite worlds/ Nanite consumeng buildings (to add as mauch compat as possible)

Make a trait that gives nanite consumption but increases assembly speed (like budding but even better)
Trait that boosts output but also increases nanite consumption of nanite buildings (governor special perk) 

Make a decision allowing Obsessional directive to turn entire planets into a consumer goods( can be uninhabited but it destroys all deposits and gives little consumer goods)
