alloy tier 2
specialised rare resources buildings(i think its also done)
 or upgrade to existing one
rare resource building for dark matter (needs something more than just nanites)
decision to recycle ships/pops

Nanotech world will get bonuses to 
less bombardment damage (-25% more or less)
+50% speed in  devastation decay (Cuz duh nanits) Parciwal says that pretrigger is needed and gatekeeper to make it work  
(If a system was occupied, we could check if the planet was bombardet and then do a staggered event fire (with multiple fires with delay). That would require 3 events i think, one that triggers the second if a system is occupied, the second calls itself until the system is unoccupied and the devastion is 0, and if the devastation ever gets above 0 and bombardment stops, the 3rd event would trigger monthly decreasing devestation by some amount until it's 0 so the second event stops. (Bearbeitet))
Ability to specialise the nanotech world maybe change Machine world AP for nanotech so that you can turn Nanite worlds into Advanced Nanite worlds(name can be changed)
nanotech tech world will increase scientist output but will give them nanite upkeep 
Nanotech Arcologies(maybe ask Planteray diversity dev to do it)

Starbase building ||Its done||
Nanite Stellar Diffuse 
Creates Artificial Nanite Storm 
Blocks Sensors
Decreases enemy fire rate and ship speed 
Decreases enemy Armor hit points by -25%


More nanite weapons
Nanite disentegrator
Nanite strike craft


Nanotech Origin 
1 for determined exterminator 
and maybe different for Obsessional directive


Civics ideas:
Flies - 1000% morale damage buff , might turn pops on the planet into pre sapient during planetary invasion or bombardment


Advanced Nanite  Authority(TO DO)
1 for non machine intellegence
1 for machine intelligence
nanite purge option
way to completely consume planets (at least 1 mil nanites, prob scale of planet size)
static opinion debuff
new bombardment stance
More nanite Edicts
Increase upkeep and output of all buildings on nanite worlds/ Nanite consumeng buildings (to add as mauch compat as possible)

Make a trait that gives nanite consumption but increases assembly speed (like budding but even better)
Trait that boosts output but also increases nanite consumption of nanite buildings (governor special perk) 

Make a decision allowing Obsessional directive to turn entire planets into a consumer goods( can be uninhabited but it destroys all deposits and gives little consumer goods)


Nanotech related Crisis path (only for machine intelligence) 
5 levels cuz UI will break if not 5
Level 1:
The Nanite trait is updated to the Advanced Nanite trait. Decrease the cost of nanite swarmers, allow players to research advanced nanite weapons, debuff to opinion of all non-nanite empires -50(maybe more), decision to consume asteroids turning them into harvested asteroids
level  2
 nanite armor, buff to all nanite weapons, the decision to consume non-habitable planets, -100 opinion debuff, tier 3 nanite building??? ,
Level 3
a bigger ship called Nanite Harvest Engine (like Star Eater but consumes systems instead of destroying them) has upgraded nanite storm aura
Harvest engine  tier 1 - Harvests planets making them uninhabitable gives big amount of nanites
Espionage mission to plant Nanite Core on one of the enemy planets (maybe the ability to choose what planet  capital has only 10% of success ) which will then start consuming a planet in 3-4 stages enemy starts a situation in which he can try to stop Nanite core from destroying  a planet and if succeeds will get a planetary blocker that gives him 100 nanites monthly . -150 opinion to non-nanite empires
Level 4:
Harvest engine  tier 2 (becomes bigger and overall better) upon the harvesting of a planet may spawn nanite fleet, gives more nanites per harvest, can harvest gas giants takes a year to do so
Nanite-infused shields (each shield gives armor and hull regen)  -175 opinion to non-nanite empires
Level 5 - everyone will start a galactic war  against you as usual.
can take control of Grey Tempest 
Advanced Nanite Trait is updated to Perfected Nanites
Galactic Harvester - Crisis Megastructure
Harvest engine  tier 3 - can now harvest entire systems and harvests faster 
Upon destruction, The Harvest engine  will release an uncontrollable nanite swarm which will consume  the entire system and every fleet inside of it
